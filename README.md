# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-TextBlob

# ABSTRACT
Data is the new oil for the market survey. Internet is the one where it constitute the huge amount of the data in the form of customer reviews, customer feedback etc., TextBlob is one of the simple API offered by python library to perform certain natural language processing task. This project implemented this method for analyzing the sentiment of the tweets using TextBlob. This project, provide a result for aforesaid data using TextBlob API using python. The project includes advantages of the proposed technique and concludes with the challenges for the decision makers when using this technique in their sentiment analysis. 

# INTRODUCTION
Sentiment Analysis as the name indicates tells us about a particular sentiment of a particular Data, it is used by companies as a means to improve their strategy and relationship with user/client and not just companies but even the users can use the sentiment analysis and detect whether a particular product is having positive , negative or a neutral review, the product might be a commodity or it might be a source of entertainment such as movies . When it comes to reviews and opinions social media sites such as twitter prove out to be very useful as people all over the world express their opinions on it . Twitter uses hashtags, where all the discussion related to the hashtag is being discussed under it , if a new movie is being released then we get to know about its reviews on twitter, if elections are being conducted then we get a brief overview of the inclination of the voters ,twitter hence proves out to be very useful for the purpose of sentiment analysis and clubbed with python and machine learning we can quantitatively analyze these reviews.

# BASIC CONCEPTS
The basic concepts used the project are: The basic knowledge of python programming such as looping,condition and control statements,creating and using functions, importing python libraries and using their respective function. Knowledge of basic and useful libraries such as pandas and matplotlib for data structures and plotting the results.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT / REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS 
Making a simple and efficient Sentiment analyzer to analyze twitter data for different purposes. For that we are required define the subject and then fetch tweets from twitter about it.Fetching recent tweets will require authentication and a fetching platform. These tweet can have hashtags, refer tos’,At signs and links which we do not require for sentiment analysis. Therefore, the tweets should be prepossessed to make it suitable for processing. A good data structure to store all the data and making it easier for processing and reviewing the results. After cleaning getting the sentiments of those tweets and plotting the results in a public friendly way.

# CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE
This project focuses on the sentiment analysis of twitter data by using python libraries such as Tweepy to use the twitter API to fetch the tweets and library such as textblob to provide sentiments to the text and then finally using matplotlib library to graphically display the sentiment of the the text. For the future improvement and scopes. We know that the twitter tweets are of different languages depending on the country but the analysis can only be done on English language, therefore language translation can be implemented to broader the spectrum of analysis. Tweets also have emojis’ and emoticons that also represent sentiment in different context, in this project we did not implement this feature so in future this feature can be implemented for better sentiment analysis.
